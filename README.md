Regex Golf
=========

These are my answers to the regex-golf game you can find here:

http://regex.alf.nu/

Everything is written in javascript just because the game uses the js
engine for the regex, which lacks a lot of the constructs available on
the other flavors.

For now is only data about the test cases, my answers and how many points
I made for each of them. Maybe I'll add a cli runner for the game in the
future.
